# Project Customer Segmentation and Customer Lifetime Value

## Project Description:

- Customer segmentation and predictive analysis for a retail business using the "All U Need Mart" dataset.
- Utilized transaction data from January to March 2019 across multiple product lines and cities in Myanmar.
- Techniques included RFM analysis for customer segmentation and machine learning models (BetaGeoFitter and GammaGammaFitter) for predicting future customer behavior.
- Tools: Python and Tableau for data processing and visualization.

## Goals:

- Enhance understanding of customer purchase behavior and develop predictive models for future trends.
- Provide strategic insights for marketing by categorizing customers (e.g., Loyal, New, Retargeted) and forecasting their monetary contributions.

## Insights and Dependencies:

- Identified key customer segments, with 'Loyal Customers' being the most significant.
- Highlighted top-performing branches and product categories.
- Dependencies: Python (Pandas, Lifetimes, Scikit-learn) and Tableau.
- Emphasized the importance of data cleaning and preprocessing for reliable analysis.

## Advice:

- Tailor marketing strategies to different customer segments for optimal engagement and revenue growth.
- Implement targeted promotions for underperforming segments and regularly evaluate the predictive model's accuracy.
- Continuously refine data handling and incorporate feedback for improved future iterations.
